# Bean Convert
A 100% Python Based File Converter

Bean Convert is an open source Python based tool that converts many different files types.
The goal is for bean convert to be a fully functioning file converter for some of the most popular (and unpopular) file types.

Too many "free" sites want you to pay or create an account after using so many minutes of bandwith. With Bean Convert,
you don't have to pay me or anyone anything becasue... OPEN SOURCE!

Oh... Did I mention free lifetime updates too?
